# Source Code

This folder contains all Python scripts used in the project.

- `train_unsupervised.py` → main training loop for the W-Net model.  
- `evaluate.py` → evaluation and metric computation.  
- `losses.py` → implementation of Soft-N-Cut and reconstruction losses.  
- `postprocess.py` → connected components and morphological filtering.

All scripts are written in PyTorch and designed for reproducibility.
