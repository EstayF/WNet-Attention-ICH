# Results and Outputs

This folder stores generated masks, evaluation metrics, and visualization outputs.

Typical contents:
- `masks/` → predicted segmentations for each test case.  
- `metrics.csv` → Dice, IoU, and F1 scores.  
- `logs/` → training loss curves and reconstruction metrics.

Note: these files are not uploaded to GitHub due to size limits.
